# To Do List with ASP.NET MVC (Still in progress)

Source codes of my web site that I designed with ASP.NET MVC for creating to do lists .

I am designing this site for self learning. I have not so much knowledge about all technologies that I used(ajax for example), but I used them for a purpose and learned what is needed for that purpose. The site is still in progress so probably I will learn much more things in the progress.

The sites purpose is to create to do list so you can check your progress and design your path to take for your work. Well there is so much sites about this and I dont think you can improve a to do site too much. But still with that said I think to do list projects are very teaching for a programmer and that is why I am designing this site.
